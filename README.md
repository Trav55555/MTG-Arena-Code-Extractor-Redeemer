# multi-monitor-textbox-automation

This script automates the process of recognizing a textbox on multiple monitors, clicking on the textbox, and pasting a list of items into the textbox. The list of items is generated by extracting codes from a series of images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Additionally, the script checks if a specified application is open and brings it into focus before performing the automation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pyautogui
- pytesseract
- opencv-python
- screeninfo
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- pygetwindow
- Tesseract OCR installed on your system

## Installation

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

    pip install pyautogui pytesseract opencv-python screeninfo pillow pygetwindow

Install Tesseract OCR on your system. You can find installation instructions for various platforms in the [Tesseract OCR GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

## Configuration

Before using the script, make sure to update the following variables in the script:

1. Set the path to the Tesseract OCR executable:

   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'<path_to_tesseract_executable>'

2. Replace `<path_to_your_image_directory>` with the path to the directory containing your image files:

   directory = '<path_to_your_image_directory>'

3. Update the `textbox_label` variable with the text label you want to find:

   textbox_label = 'Your Text Label'

4. Define the application window title:

   app_window_title = 'Your Application Window Title'

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

    python multi_monitor_textbox_automation.py

The script will first check if the specified application window is open and bring it into focus. Then, it will take screenshots of all connected monitors, locate the textbox using the specified text label, and paste the extracted codes from the image files into the textbox. If the application window is not found, the script will print a message and exit.
